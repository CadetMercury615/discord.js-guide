# Installing a proper editor
While Notepad may work for typing up some notes, it's not feasible to use it to write code. Instead,
we recommend that you use a proper editor.

An editor offers you syntax highlighting, auto-completion and makes writing good, readable code much
easier.

We aren't biased towards any editor, but here are a few that you can select:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
